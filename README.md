This dataset consits of cryptocurrency price changes within various time periods. 
# Analysis
- In this project I used unserpivsed learning with the K-Means method to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
- The K-means method did not produce good results since the number of features was too large. 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the number of features and create 3 clusters.
